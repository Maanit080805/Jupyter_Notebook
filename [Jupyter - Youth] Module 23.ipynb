    "# Classification of text data\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular application of Natural Language processing is to classify text data. Classification can be done in various form: we can classify if a tweet is related to a particular topic or not, or we can classify if a particular review leans towards positive or negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will hone our skills in classifying NLP data using NLP! \n",
    "Firstly, we will collect, analyze and process our data. We will be using bag of words and tf-idf (remember the activity that we have done in the acquire stage?). These processes turn texts into numbers. \n",
    "We will then take the word vectors we have created and use a machine learning algorithm to learn from the data and come up with a model to do our classification task. \n",

    "For our first task, we will use a collection of tweet data to predict if the tweets are referring to natural disasters, or just regular tweets.\n",
